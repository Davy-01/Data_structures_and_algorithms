# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

# AUTHOR
Davis N

The challenge consists of three questions;
    1. Stacks
    2. Sequences
    3. Dictionaries

# DESCRIPTION
This code consists of three files checking on different data structure funcionalities. 

# INSTRUCTIONS
 To work on this repository:
- Fork the repository to your remote account
- Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the location to store the repository
- Copy url from the local repository and Git clone into it (git clone ${URL})
- Navigate to the working repository and type code . to open the code editor
- In terminal run the command 
    pipenv install
- This installs the necessary pip files
- Copy and paste the codes in the python shell.
- Make regular commits for any changes in the working files.
- Once done, <git add .> on the terminal
- Git commit -m "<text>"
- Git push
The changes should now be passed to the remote repository 


# OBJECTIVES
 1. Stacks 
 - The function is supposed to check for balanced expressions that returns true if balanced and false if not.

 2. Sequences
 - The function should remove duplicates and maintain the same order of elements for the remaining

 3. Dictionaries
 - Have a function that checks on frequency of a word in a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency
